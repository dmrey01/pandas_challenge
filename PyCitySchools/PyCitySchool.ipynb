    "Upon initial review of the data, there seems to be no significant variations in the numbers. There are only a few outliers scattered throughout. However, upon further analysis, it becomes evident that there is a correlation between the budget and the student population of the schools. This correlation highlights how some schools have a higher student-to-teacher ratio than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon delving deeper into the data, I came across some interesting findings. The bottom 5 performing schools, based on the percentage of students passing overall, all belong to the same district and have similar scores in all 3 areas surveyed. Additionally, it is surprising to note that the average math score falls in the mid to upper 70's, but the percentage of students passing math is in the low 60's. The overall passing rate for the school is even lower, at around 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "When examining the data by grade level, the math and reading scores remain fairly consistent across all grades in both areas. There are no major surprises or outliers in this regard.\n",
    "When examining the data by grade level, the math and reading scores show consistency across all grades in both areas. There are no significant surprises or outliers in this aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing the scores based on school spending, one particular school stands out. Despite having the highest number of students and spending more per student, it has the lowest overall passing scores. Without further information about the school's location or demographics, it is challenging to determine the reasons behind this. It could potentially be an outlier influenced by factors such as city, demographics, or income.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our final data frame, when comparing the average math, reading, and overall passing scores between charter and district schools, the schools remained consistent in terms of average reading scores and math scores, with less than a 10% difference. However, when it comes to percent passing scores, there is a noticeable difference. The district scores show a decrease in their scores, with a passing math percentage ranging from 66.5% and a passing reading percentage of 81%. The overall passing percentage is low at 53.7%. On the other hand, charter schools show average math and reading scores ranging at 83%. The percentage passing math and reading range from 93.6% and 96.5%, respectively, with an overall passing percentage of 90.4%. It is evident that charter schools have a slight advantage over the district. The overall passing rate for charter schools is 36.76%.\n",
